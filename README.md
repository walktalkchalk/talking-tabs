## Getting started 

You will need yarn or npm installed. 

In the project directory, run: 

```
yarn install 
yarn build
```

This will create a build folder within the repository. 

Go to Google Chrome extensions: `chrome://extensions/`

Click "Load Unpacked" and select the build folder of this repository from the dialog box. 

Using the "Details" button, you can enable the extension on Incognito mode as well. When you make a change, you'll need to run the build again and click the reload icon in chrome extensions.
